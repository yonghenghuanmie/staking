# staking
## introduce
Using Anchor, we'd like you to build a basic xToken staking program. A user should be able to deposit a specific token into a program-controlled vault and receive a proof of staking (PoS) token 1:1, and conversely redeem the PoS token for the locked tokens. Tests must be included.
